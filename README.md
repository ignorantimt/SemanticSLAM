Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is one of the fundamental capabilities for intelligent mobile robots to perform state estimation in unknown environments. However, most visual SLAM systems **rely on the static scene assumption** and consequently have severely reduced accuracy and robustness in dynamic scenes. Moreover, the metric maps constructed by many systems **lack semantic information**, so the robots cannot understand their surroundings at a human cognitive level. 

In this paper, we propose SG-SLAM, which is a real-time RGB-D semantic visual SLAM system based on the [ORB-SLAM2](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2) framework. First, SG-SLAM adds two new parallel threads: an object detecting thread to obtain 2D semantic information and a semantic mapping thread. Then, a **fast dynamic feature rejection algorithm combining semantic and geometric information** is added to the tracking thread. Finally, they are published to the ROS system for visualization after generating 3D point clouds and 3D semantic objects in the **semantic mapping thread**. 

We performed an experimental evaluation on the TUM dataset, the Bonn dataset, and the OpenLORIS-Scene dataset. The results show that SG-SLAM is not only one of the most real-time, accurate, and robust systems in dynamic scenes, but also allows the creation of intuitive semantic metric maps.

## 5. Other

### 5.1 octomap_server

/SG-SLAM/src/octomap_server/launch/octomap.launch

This file is used to start the octomap_server node and configure some parameters. You can see what these parameters mean here(http://wiki.ros.org/octomap_server、https://octomap.github.io/)

Among them, the **param name=resolution** parameter indicates the voxel resolution of the octomap. The smaller the parameter, the finer the map voxel segmentation and the higher the resolution. But the processing time and computational complexity also increase.

The **occupancy_min_z** and **occupancy_max_z** parameters can selectively pass through the point cloud within the z-axis range. If your initial camera view is parallel to the ground, you can also use the occupancy_min_z parameter to do a trick to filter out the ground. Similarly, the occupancy_min_z parameter can be used to filter out the top voxels of the house.

**filter_ground** is the normal algorithm for filtering out the ground (not the trick of directly using occupancy_min_z to filter out the ground). Usage can refer to the above URL.

- PointCloudMapping.is_map_construction_consider_dynamic

When performing octomap or 3D point cloud map builds, dynamic objects in the map can affect the quality of the map build. When this parameter is set to 1, the map will be built with dynamic objects excluded as much as possible (the code implementation is to exclude pedestrians), i.e., no dynamic objects will be built in map. If there is no dynamic object class in scenes, this parameter can be set to 0.

- PointCloudMapping.camera_valid_depth_Min and PointCloudMapping.camera_valid_depth_Max

RGB-D depth cameras have effective observation range limits for depth image data due to hardware and principle limitations. These two parameters are used to limit the effective value range of the depth image. They can be adjusted according to the camera model, and the default effective range here is 0.5 m to 5 m.

- PointCloudMapping.is_octo_semantic_map_construction

Whether to build octomap and semantic object metric map, 1 is to build, 0 is not to build.

- PointCloudMapping.Sor_Local_MeanK，PointCloudMapping.Sor_Local_StddevMulThresh and PointCloudMapping.Voxel_Local_LeafSize

If is_octo_semantic_map_construction is set to 1, namely, octomap will be constructed. these three parameters function as filter setting parameters for filtering the 3D point cloud obtained from the camera depth image conversion.

Take Voxel_Local_LeafSize as an example :

It can be seen from the code when System.cc reads the yaml configuration file that this parameter is finally passed to the Voxel filter object constructor in the **PointCloudMapping** class.

This parameter is finally passed to the **voxel filter object**, which is the resolution used for voxel filtering on the point cloud after the depth map is transformed into a 3D point cloud. Because the number of 3D point clouds directly converted from the depth map is large (640*480), the calculation burden is heavy, so filtering is performed. The resolution of the voxel filter is similar to that of the octomap, that is, the centroid of the same position is replaced, so that the amount of calculation is reduced. 

After my test, it is generally set to 0.01 on my device, and the calculation efficiency and effect have reached a good balance. Adjustable to individual hardware.

- PointCloudMapping.is_global_pc_reconstruction

Whether to perform 3D point cloud map reconstruction, 1 is to do it, 0 is not to do it. Since map construction requires a significant computational cost, it is generally recommended that this parameter and the PointCloudMapping.is_octo_semantic_map_construction parameter not be turned on at the same time.

- PointCloudMapping.Sor_Global_MeanK, PointCloudMapping.Sor_Global_StddevMulThresh and PointCloudMapping.Voxel_Global_LeafSize

these parameters work similarly to parameters like PointCloudMapping.Sor_Local_MeanK.

- Detector3D.Sor_MeanK, Detector3D.Sor_StddevMulThresh and Detector3D.Voxel_LeafSize

These parameters act similar to parameters like PointCloudMapping.Sor_Local_MeanK. They are the parameters for filtering the point cloud clusters in the detection frame when acquiring 3D semantic objects. The following parameters of the Euclidean clustering settings are also used to extract the point cloud clusters of the target objects as accurately as possible.

- Detector3D.EuclideanClusterTolerance, Detector3D.EuclideanClusterMinSize, Detector3D.EuclideanClusterMaxSize

The setting parameters for Euclidean clustering segmentation of the point clouds in the object detection boundingbox. The purpose is to segment the point cloud of the target object among the point clouds in the detection frame as accurately as possible.

- Detector3D.DetectSimilarCompareRatio

The ratio parameter for filtering when finding the similarity match between a point cloud cluster and its target object. The effect is similar to that of the **mfNNratio** variable when performing bag-of-words matching in ORB-SLAM2. The smaller this value is, the more stringent the screening is.

- Detector3D.global_pc_update_kf_threshold

Functions such as global 3D point cloud map filtering and publishing in real time are very computationally intensive, so normally only each frame of the point cloud is processed and added to the global map. Only when the system is idle (no new keyframes in the buffer queue) or when the number of processed keyframes exceeds the current threshold parameter will the global point cloud filtering and publishing operations be performed.

- Detector2D.detection_confidence_threshold

A confidence threshold for detecting common objects, and a detection result is considered credible only if it is higher than this threshold. A low setting of this threshold may cause the semantic object metric map to detect the wrong target. Setting it too high may result in difficulty in acquiring some targets that are not easily discernible. Therefore it needs to be set according to the environment. There is a strong relationship with the current detection model.

- Detector2D.dynamic_detection_confidence_threshold

Confidence threshold when detecting dynamic objects, and the detection result is considered credible only if it is higher than this threshold. The reason for this threshold being set low is that dynamic objects have a greater negative impact on system tracking and map building. Therefore the detection results of dynamic objects need to be trusted as much as possible.

### 5.3 dynamic feature processing code

The code is located in the **RmDynamicPointWithSemanticAndGeometry** function of Frame.cc

### 5.4 octomap_server partial map "disappearance" problem

The problem that some octree maps would "disappear" when Octomap built a map in the last version has been solved (rewritten the code of topic publishing function for point cloud and tf information).
